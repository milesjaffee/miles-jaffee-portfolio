summary: 'Tools, languages, and frameworks I use.'

I use a variety of tools, languages, and frameworks in my work! Here's an overview (last updated March 11, 2025):

## Languages

### Java and its ecosystem

Java was my first language, and perhaps it will be my last. Just a good overall way of doing things. Everything is laid out in such an aesthetically pleasing way.

### C and C++

I took systems software with Professor Mark Erle, an old-style stickler who made sure we knew how to malloc manually as well as use the basics of C++. Since then, I've progressed to a stronger understanding of this mind-bogglingly fast language.

### React Web and React Native

A beautifully elegant way of creating a frontend.

### HTML and CSS

Ok, who doesn't know these? Even a business major should be able to wrangle their way around making "static webpage type beat" with these.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

Numerous classes have required JavaScript to build responsive webpages. TypeScript is pretty fun.

### Python

I also know Python. Sorry, can't think of anything funny to say about it. 

## Frameworks

### Vercel

Built this page.

### Git version control

Extensive familiarity. I also know how to do the weird stuff like rebases. People who can only add/commit are scared of me. I'm constantly getting asked for help at recitations.
